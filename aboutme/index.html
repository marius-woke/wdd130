    <p>Hey! I'm Marius and I major in Computer Information Technology but I would be switching to Cybersecurity by next spring when the major is available at BYUI. It's my second semester here and so far, its been pretty good. I am from Nigeria and I come from a family of 8, 2 sisters and 3 brothers. In my free time, I love playing PUBG mobile and Call of duty mobile. I prefer mobile FPP/TPP multiplayer games because I can use gyroscope to stabilize my guns recoil and aim better than on a console. I love football alot and my Idol is Lionel Messi. Someday, I hope to work for the CIA, FBI or the MI6</p>
